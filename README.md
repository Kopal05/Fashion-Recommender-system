## Introduction
Fashion recommender systems utilize advanced technologies like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transfer learning to analyze clothing images and offer personalized recommendations. By leveraging CNNs' image analysis capabilities and transfer learning's domain adaptation, these systems enhance recommendation accuracy, making online fashion shopping more efficient and enjoyable for users.

## Installation
git clone 

download required files and packages
use pycharm or jupyter notebook and run the program



## Algorithms

## CNN: 
CNNs, or Convolutional Neural Networks, are specialized deep learning models designed for processing and analyzing visual data like images. They consist of interconnected layers that extract features from images through filters, reducing complexity while preserving important information. By leveraging techniques like convolution and pooling, CNNs can recognize patterns, shapes, and objects within images, making them invaluable in tasks such as image classification, object detection, and facial recognition.

## Transfer Learning 
Transfer learning is a machine learning method where knowledge gained from solving one problem is applied to a different but related problem. In the context of neural networks, it involves reusing pre-trained models trained on large datasets and fine-tuning them for specific tasks, which accelerates learning and improves performance, especially when limited data is available.
